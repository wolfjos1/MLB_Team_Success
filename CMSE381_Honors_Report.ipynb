    "Major League Baseball is a league centered around statistics. Since the 1800s, teams and scorekeepers have been tracking meaningful and relavant data. With all this data available, many questions are sparked and answered. The question I decided to focus on centers around winning and team success. In this project, I analyzed what affects winning the most in the MLB. More specifically, I looked at win totals while also focusing on making the playoffs as quantifying \"winning\"."
